# drugADR
The project involves prediction of side effects prediction using existing data ([SIDER](http://http://sideeffects.embl.de/)) by leveraging machine learning with statistical data analysis. During the course of this work the following tasks were performed:
- Dealing with biological, chemical data.
- Computational manipulation of data from drugs and phenotypic side effects.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for prediction of side effects.

## Pre-requisites
The following are a couple of instructions to execute different (or all) sections of the project.
1. Clone the project, replacing `drugADR` with the name of the directory you are creating:
`git clone https://github.com/sominwadhwa/drugADR.git drugADR
cd drugADR`
