The project involves prediction of side effects prediction using existing data ([SIDER](http://http://sideeffects.embl.de/)) by leveraging machine learning with statistical data analysis. During the course of this work the following tasks were performed:
- Dealing with biological, chemical data.
- Computational manipulation of data from drugs and phenotypic side effects.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for prediction of side effects.
